<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p class = "lead">
So you're a sheep falling from the sky, and your goal is to get out of 
each box and get back down to the earth. Click the left/right buttons, 
or hit the right/left arrow keys to turn the map in those directions. 
Pay attention to the obstacles, and don't get eaten by the wolf!

<h3>We're looking for help!</h3>
